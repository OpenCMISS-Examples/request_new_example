A repository for creating issues that request a new example repository.

Process for getting a new repository created
--------------------------------------------

The following instructions provide guidance on how to get a new example repository created within this organisation where you do not have authority to do so:

#. Create an `new issue <https://github.com/OpenCMISS-Examples/request_new_example/issues/new>`_ on this repository.
#. In the issue:

  #. Specify the name of the new repository.
  #. Specify the license for the new repository that you would like.
  
If you do not specify a license for your new repository the Apache license will be chosen be default.

When an issue is approved a new repository will be created by the organisation maintainers this will enable you to create a pull request against the new repository that will then be reviewed and subsequently (once review comments have been dealt with) merged in.
