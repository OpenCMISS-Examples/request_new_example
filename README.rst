Request New Example
===================

A repository for creating issues that request a new example repository.  If you have a new example that you would like to be added to the OpenCMISS-Examples organisation then create an issue against this repository that details the name of the new repository you would like. 

In your request you can specify the license that should be added otherwise the default Apache license will be set.

When an issue is approved a new repository will be created by the organisation maintainers for you to create a pull request against.

Adding New Example
==================

When creating a new example the following actions should be done:

#. Use the new button to add the new repository.
#. Assign a license to the repository, Apache by default or otherwise specified in the issue.
#. Create a branch 'develop' from 'master'.
#. Set the 'develop' branch as the default branch in the project settings.
